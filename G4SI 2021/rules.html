<h1> Rules for Road to Ruin</h1>
<h2>Major Mechanics</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Ruin</strong></dt>
<dd> At the end of each round, the ruin bar will increase by a % based on the amount of factories and green space left on the map. If the ruin bar hits 100%, everyone looses.</dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>Resources</strong></dt> 
<dd>At the end of each round, each player gains resources based on the number of factories they possess and upgrades related to factories.</dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>Joy</strong></dt> 
<dd> Each player has a separate joy meter that changes at the end of each round. If the joy of your population falls too far, your resource production will suffer. Increase joy by having a higher ratio of residences to factories and by reducing polution.</dd>
<br>

<h2>Buildings</h2>

<h4>Buildings must be placed within 4 squares of an existing building you own.</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Factories</strong></dt>
<dd> One of the two main buildings of the game. By default, a single factory produces 1 unit per turn. Additionally, factories 'blacken the land' and produce ruin. You can not have more factories than you have population. If your population drops below your factory number, your newest factories becomes inactive.</dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>Residences</strong></dt>
<dd> The other main building of the game. Having more residences than factories can help improve your joy. </dd>
</dl>
<dt><strong>Nukes</strong></dt>
<dd> Once unlocked with upgrades, the nuke can be placed on an opponent's buildings to destroy factories or residences. Bombs also cause a permentant increased rate of ruin. </dd>
</dl>
<br>
<h2>Upgrades</h2>
<h4>Each player has several upgrade paths available to them. The first upgrade costs 5 resources. The second costs 10. The third costs 25.</h4>

<h2>Winning the game</h2>
<h4>The first player to achieve 150 resources wins the game. If ruin ever hits 100%, everyone looses. </h4>

<h2>Starting the game</h2>
Each player starts the game with 10 resource points. These can be spent to create factories, residences, and buy upgrades.

<h2>Playing each round </h2>
Each round, each player starts by buying any number of upgrades and activating any number of abilities (only ability currently is the attack). Then, they may place 1 building on any legal square.
