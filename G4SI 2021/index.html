  <h1>Welcome to Road to Ruin!</h1>
  <h5>Will you win the Rat Race, or will you bring ruin to us all?</h5>
  <h3>Overview</h3>

In following with this year's game jam theme, Ruin, we've created a game to display the effect of poorly regulated capitalism on the surrounding ecosystem. In ruin, players (2-4 allowed) are tasked with obtaining resources and settling cities on a fresh plot of land, and in competition for resources, upgrades, and comfortable ways of living, aim to create wonderous civilizations! Be on the watch for the ramifications of every development, for the luxuries of the world can quickly come at a price, and a board full of these wonderful developments can soon turn from the luscious green field of origin to a blackened and barren wasteland. Being able to manage the competition and advance to the goal of 150 material points in this territorial development game while being able to weigh the environment itself along with the joy of your citizens is no easy task, but for those that are up to the challenge, Road to Ruin invites all!

<h3>Theme</h3>

This game was designed to give further attention to the current global climate crisis on earth. The board itself is designed to be a neutral and obscure play space to represent the fact that this is not locked to one region or peoples on this planet, but that the Ruin approaches for us all.



<h3>Controls</h3>

â€‹On each players turn, that player may purchase any number of upgrades and up to one building. To purchase an upgrade, click on the grey squares on your player card. The active player's player card is colored lighter than the other player cards. To purchase a building, select a building by clicking on its icon on your player card and then click the square on the board where you want to place that building. Placing a building will end your turn. If you do not wish to place a building on your turn, you may end the turn manually with the 'End Turn' button. Resources are generated at the end of each turn cycle. The game ends when a player reaches 150 material points (the column on the right of the player card), or when the ruin bar reaches 100%. If the ruin bar is ever filled, all player loose the game.
