# RoadToRuin
Game for Games for social impact 2021

In following with this year's game jam theme, Ruin, we've created a game to display the effect of poorly regulated capitalism on the surrounding ecosystem. In ruin, players (2-4 allowed) are tasked with obtaining resources and settling cities on a fresh plot of land, and in competition for resources, upgrades, and comfortable ways of living, aim to create wonderous civilizations! Be on the watch for the ramifications of every development, for the luxuries of the world can quickly come at a price, and a board full of these wonderful developments can soon turn from the luscious green field of origin to a blackened and barren wasteland. Being able to manage the competition and advance to the goal of 150 development points in this territorial development game while being able to weigh the environment itself along with the joy of your citizens is no easy task, but for those that are up to the challenge, Road to Ruin invites all!
